# Silk! 
Silk is a simple, and, for the most part efficient Discord bot written in C#, with the aid of DSharpPlus for Discord API wrapping. The goal of Silk! is be not only a great bot, but fill in the gaps that certain bots have. A bot your members will want to use, while not being a cookie-cutter game, moderation, or entertainment bot. Silk! also large guilds in mind. Feel free to join the [Silk! server](https://discord.gg/HZfZb95) to ask any questions you may have or any general support you may need. Want this bot on your server?

## Development 
Silk! Is an open source bot, obviously, and if you know C#, you're more than welcome to contribute! If you're on the server, and your PR gets merged, you get a nice light blue role on the server to signify your contributions. Active contributers are given a special role as well.

## ⚠️ A NOTE ABOUT SELF-HOSTING ⚠️
### Planning to self-host the bot? Glad to hear. Unfortunately, as it stands right now, we're a small team, and cannot provide active support for self-hosting.
### Pre-requisites and requisite resources will be listed as the bot changes, which are the bare minimum for the bot to run.
